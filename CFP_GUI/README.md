This is the GUI version of CFP Neural Network.
The library being used is python build-in: Tkinter.

The process of the program is first: CFP extraction, then pass the extracted data to the Neural Network.
The extracted data types are cepstrum and GCoS respectively.

Then the program will output one file and show the figure in a new window.
The output will be used for the part of performance. See details in README in MusicVisualization folder.

Here are two things to be aware of.
One is that the input audio can only be .wav formated.
And second is that the program currently can only predict on pure piano performance, due to the pre-trained model.

So, that's all.
Hope you can enjoy this project^^
